# Project Brief: LearningMaster-MCP

## 1. Introduction

LearningMaster-MCP (LearningMaster - Memory Capture Platform) is a personal knowledge management system designed to capture, organize, and retrieve coding knowledge effectively. It leverages the power of Notion databases to store and structure information, aiming to improve developer productivity and project efficiency by providing a centralized and easily searchable repository of coding solutions, best practices, and learnings.

## 2. Project Vision

The vision for LearningMaster-MCP is to become the ultimate personal coding knowledge base for developers. It aims to empower developers to quickly access and reuse their past experiences, solutions, and learnings, reducing time spent re-solving problems and promoting consistent, high-quality code.  We envision a seamless integration with the developer workflow, making knowledge capture and retrieval a natural and intuitive part of the coding process.

## 3. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

*   **Develop a robust and reliable MCP server:** The server should be stable, scalable, and capable of handling a growing knowledge base.
*   **Implement seamless integration with Notion:** Allow users to connect their Notion databases and define the structure for storing coding knowledge.
*   **Create an intuitive and efficient search functionality:** Enable users to quickly find relevant information within their knowledge base.
*   **Provide a user-friendly interface:** Ensure the platform is easy to use and navigate, even for developers with limited experience in knowledge management systems.
*   **Support various coding languages and frameworks:**  Offer flexible tagging and categorization options to accommodate a diverse range of coding knowledge.
*   **Automate knowledge capture (future development):** Explore options for automatically capturing code snippets, documentation links, and other relevant information from the developer's environment.

## 4. Target Audience

The target audience for LearningMaster-MCP includes:

*   **Software Developers:**  Individual developers looking to improve their personal productivity and knowledge management practices.
*   **Software Engineering Teams:** Teams who want to create a shared knowledge base to improve collaboration and knowledge sharing.
*   **Students and Learners:**  Individuals learning to code and looking for a structured way to organize their knowledge and track their progress.

## 5. Key Features

The key features of LearningMaster-MCP will include:

*   **Notion Database Integration:**  Seamless connection to Notion databases for storing and organizing coding knowledge.
*   **Customizable Data Structures:**  Ability to define custom database schemas within Notion to suit individual needs.
*   **Powerful Search Functionality:**  Advanced search capabilities to quickly find relevant information based on keywords, tags, and other criteria.
*   **Code Snippet Management:**  Dedicated support for storing and managing code snippets with syntax highlighting and language identification.
*   **Tagging and Categorization:**  Flexible tagging and categorization options to organize knowledge based on language, framework, topic, or project.
*   **Markdown Support:**  Full support for Markdown formatting to create rich and readable knowledge entries.
*   **API Access (future development):**  API access for integration with other development tools and workflows.

## 6. Success Criteria

The success of LearningMaster-MCP will be measured by:

*   **User Adoption:**  Number of active users and level of engagement with the platform.
*   **Knowledge Base Size:**  Amount of coding knowledge captured and stored within the system.
*   **Search Efficiency:**  Speed and accuracy of search results.
*   **User Satisfaction:**  Feedback from users regarding the usability and effectiveness of the platform.
*   **Project Efficiency Improvement:**  Observable improvements in developer productivity and project efficiency (measured through surveys and anecdotal evidence).
*   **System Stability:**  Minimal downtime and error rates.

## 7. Timeline

The project is planned to be completed in the following phases:

*   **Phase 1 (4 weeks):** Core MCP server development and Notion integration.
*   **Phase 2 (3 weeks):** Implementation of search functionality and user interface.
*   **Phase 3 (2 weeks):** Testing, bug fixing, and documentation.
*   **Phase 4 (Ongoing):** Maintenance, support, and future feature development.

Therefore, a realistic timeline for the initial release (Phases 1-3) is **9 weeks**.
