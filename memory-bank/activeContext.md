# Active Context: LearningMaster-MCP (Sprint 1)

This document provides a snapshot of the current project status for LearningMaster-MCP, outlining sprint goals, ongoing tasks, known issues, priorities, and next steps.

## Current Sprint Goals (Sprint 1: Foundation)

The primary goals for this sprint are to:

*   **Establish core architecture:** Define the fundamental structure of the LearningMaster-MCP server, including API endpoints and data models.
*   **Notion Integration (Read-Only):** Implement the ability to read data from specified Notion databases. This includes authentication, database selection, and data extraction.
*   **Basic Knowledge Indexing:** Create a basic indexing mechanism to store and retrieve coding knowledge extracted from Notion.
*   **Proof-of-Concept API Endpoint:** Develop a simple API endpoint that returns indexed coding knowledge based on a keyword search.

## Ongoing Tasks

*   **API Design & Documentation:** Finalizing the API specification using OpenAPI/Swagger.  Assignee: John Doe, Deadline: 2025-05-27
*   **Notion API Authentication Implementation:** Implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication with the Notion API. Assignee: Jane Smith, Deadline: 2025-05-28
*   **Database Schema Design (Initial):** Defining the database schema for storing indexed coding knowledge. Assignee: Peter Jones, Deadline: 2025-05-29
*   **Keyword Extraction Algorithm (Basic):** Implementing a simple keyword extraction algorithm for processing Notion content. Assignee: Jane Smith, Deadline: 2025-05-30
*   **PoC API Endpoint Development:** Building the initial API endpoint for querying indexed knowledge. Assignee: John Doe, Deadline: 2025-05-31

## Known Issues

*   **Rate Limiting:** The Notion API is subject to rate limiting. We need to implement strategies to handle rate limits gracefully (e.g., exponential backoff).  Status: In Progress (Jane Smith)
*   **Complex Notion Content:**  Handling complex Notion content (e.g., nested blocks, equations) requires further investigation and may need to be addressed in a future sprint. Status: Open, requiring investigation.
*   **Database Choice:** Final decision on the database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) is still pending.  Status: Open, requiring discussion with Peter Jones.

## Priorities

1.  **Notion API Authentication:** Essential for accessing Notion data.
2.  **Database Schema Design:**  Critical for structuring the indexed knowledge.
3.  **API Design & Documentation:**  Ensures a clear and consistent API for future development.
4.  **PoC API Endpoint Development:**  Validates the core functionality of the system.
5.  **Rate Limiting Handling:**  Prevents service disruptions due to exceeding Notion API limits.

## Next Steps

*   **Complete Notion API Authentication:** Focus on finishing the OAuth 2.0 implementation and testing its functionality. (Jane Smith)
*   **Database Technology Decision:** Discuss and finalize the database technology choice with the team. (Peter Jones, John Doe, Jane Smith) - Meeting scheduled for 2025-05-26.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting Handling:** Begin implementing rate limiting strategies in the Notion API interaction. (Jane Smith)
*   **Document API Endpoints:**  Continue documenting the API endpoints as they are developed. (John Doe)

## Meeting Notes (2025-05-24)

*   **Attendees:** John Doe, Jane Smith, Peter Jones
*   **Topics Discussed:**
    *   **Notion API Rate Limiting:** Discussed the impact of rate limits and potential solutions (e.g., caching, exponential backoff). Jane Smith will investigate and implement a solution.
    *   **Database Choice:**  Reviewed the pros and cons of PostgreSQL and SQLite.  PostgreSQL was favored for its scalability and features, but the complexity of setup and deployment was a concern.  The team agreed to further research the deployment options for PostgreSQL. Peter Jones will lead this effort.
    *   **Keyword Extraction:**  Discussed the need for a more sophisticated keyword extraction algorithm in the future.  For the initial PoC, a simple TF-IDF approach will be sufficient.
