# Progress Report - LearningMaster-MCP

**Date:** 2025-05-25

## Completed Tasks

*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   [x] Implemented Notion API integration for reading database content.
    *   [x] Developed data parsing logic to extract relevant coding knowledge from Notion pages (code snippets, explanations, links).
    *   [x] Created initial data model for storing extracted knowledge (title, content, tags, source URL).
    *   [x] Established basic server structure (using Flask).
    *   [x] Implemented a simple search functionality using keyword matching.
    *   [x] Developed API endpoint for knowledge retrieval based on search queries.
    *   [x] Initialized database connection (SQLite for development).
*   **User Interface (CLI - Initial Version):**
    *   [x] Created a basic command-line interface for interacting with the server.
    *   [x] Implemented commands for:
        *   `index`: Indexing a specific Notion database.
        *   `search`: Searching for knowledge based on keywords.
        *   `view`: Viewing a specific knowledge entry.
*   **Testing:**
    *   [x] Wrote unit tests for the data parsing logic.
    *   [x] Performed integration tests to verify Notion API connectivity.
    *   [x] Conducted manual testing of the search functionality.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   [x] Created initial project README with setup instructions.

## Milestones

*   **Milestone 1 (Achieved):** Core functionality implemented and basic search working (Completed 2025-05-18).
*   **Milestone 2 (In Progress):** Improved search algorithm and user interface. (Target: 2025-06-01)
*   **Milestone 3 (Planned):** Integration with code editor extensions. (Target: 2025-06-15)

## Test Results

*   **Unit Tests (Data Parsing):** 95% passing. Failing tests relate to handling specific edge cases in Notion content formatting.
*   **Integration Tests (Notion API):** Successful connection and data retrieval. Occasional rate limiting errors observed; implementing retry logic.
*   **Manual Testing (Search):**
    *   Basic keyword search is functional.
    *   Relevance ranking needs improvement.
    *   Handling of complex queries is limited.

## Performance Metrics

*   **Indexing Time:** Approximately 10 seconds per 100 Notion pages (initial indexing). Optimization needed for larger databases.
*   **Search Latency:** Average 0.5 seconds for simple queries. Increases with database size and query complexity.
*   **Memory Usage:** Acceptable for development environment. Monitoring required for production deployment.

## Feedback Summary

*   **Usability:** CLI is functional but not user-friendly. A graphical user interface or code editor integration is highly desired.
*   **Search Relevance:** Search results are not always relevant. Need to explore more advanced search algorithms (e.g., TF-IDF, semantic search).
*   **Data Model:** The current data model is sufficient for basic knowledge storage. Consider adding support for different knowledge types (e.g., tutorials, best practices).
*   **Notion Integration:** Handle Notion API rate limits gracefully. Allow users to configure API keys.

## Changelog
