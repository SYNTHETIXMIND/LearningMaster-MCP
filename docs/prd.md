# LearningMaster-MCP Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**LearningMaster-MCP** is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that revolutionizes how developers capture, organize, and retrieve their coding knowledge. By seamlessly integrating with Notion databases, it creates a persistent, searchable knowledge base that transforms debugging experiences and accelerates project development.

The server addresses a critical pain point in software development: the loss of valuable problem-solving insights and the repetitive nature of debugging similar issues across projects. LearningMaster-MCP ensures that every learning moment becomes a reusable asset, dramatically improving personal productivity and project efficiency.

**Target Audience:** Solo developers, development teams, coding students, consultants, and open-source contributors who want to build and maintain comprehensive knowledge bases of their technical learnings.
