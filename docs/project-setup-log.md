# Project Setup Log for LearningMaster-MCP

This document outlines the steps taken to initialize and set up the LearningMaster-MCP project environment.

## Phase 1: Taskmaster-AI Initialization & Task Creation

1.  **Installed Taskmaster MCP Server**:
    *   Cloned `https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master` into `C:\Users\Tom\Documents\Cline\MCP\claude-task-master`.
    *   Ran `npm install` (after removing the `chmod` command from the `prepare` script in `package.json` for Windows compatibility).
    *   Added the server to `c:\Users\Tom\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json`.
        *   Initially configured with server name `github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master`.
        *   Later, user updated settings, and the active server became `taskmaster-ai` (using npx).

2.  **Initialized Taskmaster-AI for the Project**:
    *   Used the `taskmaster-ai` MCP server's `initialize_project` tool.
    *   Project root: `c:/Github/LearningMaster-MCP`.
    *   This created the `.taskmasterconfig` file and initial `memory-bank` folder structure.

3.  **Read and Prepared PRD**:
    *   Read the content of `/docs/prd.md`.
    *   Wrote this content to `c:/Github/LearningMaster-MCP/scripts/prd.txt` for use with the `parse_prd` tool.

4.  **Parsed PRD and Generated Tasks**:
    *   Used the `taskmaster-ai` MCP server's `parse_prd` tool with `scripts/prd.txt` as input.
    *   Initial attempts with `numTasks: "25"` and `numTasks: "15"` timed out, likely due to the PRD's size and the AI processing involved.
    *   However, `tasks/tasks.json` was successfully generated with 25 top-level tasks.

5.  **Expanded Tasks with Subtasks**:
    *   Attempted to use `expand_all` tool, which also timed out but partially processed some tasks.
    *   Iteratively used the `expand_task` tool for remaining tasks (IDs 8-25, as 1-7 were processed by `expand_all` or subsequent calls before I could check).
    *   All 25 tasks in `tasks/tasks.json` now have generated subtasks.
    *   This completes Phase 1 as per user requirements.

## Phase 2: Project Structure Setup

6.  **Initialized Project Directory Structure**:
    *   Based on Node.js best practices (component-based structure from `/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices` via Context7).
    *   Created directories: `apps/`, `libs/`, `docs/learnings/`, `docs/api/`, `docs/guides/`, `src/`, `tests/`.
    *   Nested structure within `apps/` for each primary tool (e.g., `apps/write_learning/api`, `apps/write_learning/domain`, etc.).
    *   Nested structure within `libs/` for shared components (e.g., `libs/mcp_server_core`, `libs/notion_integration`, etc.).

7.  **Set Up Cursor Memory Bank**:
    *   Used `github.com/tuncer-byte/memory-bank-MCP` server's `initialize_memory_bank` tool.
    *   Goal: "To create an MCP server, LearningMaster-MCP, for capturing, organizing, and retrieving developer coding knowledge by integrating with Notion databases, aimed at improving personal productivity and project efficiency."
    *   Location: `c:/Github/LearningMaster-MCP`.
    *   The tool auto-generated context files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md` in the `memory-bank/` directory.

8.  **Created Initial Knowledge Graph Entities**:
    *   Used `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory` server's `create_entities` tool.
    *   Extracted and added stakeholders, technologies, and key concepts from the PRD.
        *   Stakeholders: "Alex the Efficiency-Focused Developer", "Sam the Team Lead", "Thomas Dobler - SYNTHETIXMIND LTD", "Developer Community".
        *   Technologies: MCP, Notion API, Node.js, TypeScript, Markdown, JSON Schema, Git, Jest, TypeDoc, Commander.js, Winston, string-similarity, fs-extra, lodash, moment.
        *   Key Concepts: Learning Capture, Knowledge Retrieval, Local Caching, Bidirectional Synchronization, Content Similarity Analysis.
        *   Project Entity: "LearningMaster-MCP Project".
        *   Software Tool Entities: "write_learning tool", "read_learning tool", etc.

9.  **Established Initial Knowledge Graph Relations**:
    *   Used `create_relations` tool from the memory server.
    *   Created relations like `USES_TECHNOLOGY`, `PART_OF`, `HAS_TARGET_USER`, `MAINTAINS`, `IMPLEMENTS_CONCEPT`.

## Phase 3: Development Infrastructure

10. **Set Up Automated Testing Framework (Jest)**:
    *   Installed dev dependencies: `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`, `ts-node`.
    *   Created `jest.config.ts` with `ts-jest` preset, `node` environment, and configured roots for `./src` and `./tests`.
    *   Ensured `npm test` runs and exits correctly (with "no tests found" as no actual tests exist yet).

11. **Set Up Linters and Formatters (ESLint, Prettier)**:
    *   Installed dev dependencies: `eslint`, `prettier`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-prettier`.
    *   Created `.eslintrc.js` configured for TypeScript and Prettier.
    *   Created `.prettierrc.js` with common formatting rules.
    *   Created `.prettierignore` file.

12. **Installed Main Project Dependencies**:
    *   Installed: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `@notionhq/client`, `fs-extra`, `string-similarity`, `turndown`, `commander`, `winston`, `lodash`, `moment`.
    *   Updated `package.json` with `name`, `version`, `description`, `main`, `type: "module"`, and basic `scripts` for `test`, `lint`, `format`, `build`.

13. **Created Initial Documentation Structure**:
    *   Created `docs/api/` and `docs/guides/` directories.
    *   Created placeholder files: `docs/README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/contributing.md`.

14. **Set Up Basic GitHub CI Workflow**:
    *   Used `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github` MCP server's `create_or_update_file` tool.
    *   Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in the `SYNTHETIXMIND/LearningMaster-MCP` repository (main branch).
    *   Workflow includes steps for checkout, Node.js setup (18.x, 20.x), `npm ci`, `npm run build --if-present`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test`.
    *   Branch protection rules need to be set up manually on GitHub.

## Next Steps (Phase 4 & 5)
- Document this setup process (this file).
- Update memory systems with project initialization patterns.
- Create project roadmap based on generated tasks.
- Create/Update project `README.md`.
